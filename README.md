## A MERN fullstack application where you can securely authenticate your account and view funny jokes

This application is an upgrade of one of my first projects, City Login. In laugh login, a user can create an account manually or via Oauth2.0 from social media platforms Facebook, Github, Google, or Discord. Once a user logs in they are redirected to the joke page where they can view their account details and generate jokes. The authentication flow follows industry standards by securely handling data through encryption and database storage. When a user logs out their data will remain the database for 48 hours.

## Features include
* Manual sign up form: Logs users account to database
* Manual login form: retrieves matching user from database
* Forgot password form: Updates password by username
* Comprehensive validation of user forms
* Joke generator
